# CONCLUSION 
Setting up my tech environment has been a rewarding and insightful journey. Through this process, I successfully downloaded and installed all the essential tools needed for a smooth development workflow. These include VirtualBox, Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and the Ubuntu operating system, which I now run efficiently in a virtualized environment.

I also installed Git using Homebrew on iTerm, and I’ve set up both a GitHub account and an AWS account, giving me access to industry-standard version control and cloud computing platforms.

This setup has not only deepened my understanding of development environments but has also strengthened my confidence in navigating core tools and platforms used in the tech space. With the guidance and support I received throughout the process, I’ve been able to learn at an accelerated pace and lay a solid foundation for more advanced DevOps and cloud-related projects.

I’m excited to build upon this setup and continue growing as a Cloud and DevOps Engineer.
